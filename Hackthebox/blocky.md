# Hackthebox Blocky

Before we start I always reset the box, it is often that services have crashed or behaves in unintended ways after others have exploited them. And I do not want any spoilers that may have been left by others on the box.

### Attack Summary

1. Hardcoded password
2. Overly permissive Sudo configuration


## Recon

### Service Discovey

First, as always. we perform our initial enumeration of the box using Nmap.

```
# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Fri Dec 28 09:54:49 2018 as: nmap -v -sV -p- -T4 -oA blocky_full 10.10.10.37

```

Checking the FTP and SSH services gave nothing.

Moving along there is a wordpress blog running on port 80. Let's throw wpscan on it:

We found a user called notch.

### Content Discovery 

Lets do some content discovery with gobuster:

```

We found some login portals:

- http://10.10.10.37/phpmyadmin/
- http://10.10.10.37/wp-login.php

And we found a plugins directory containing two jar files. 

To decompile the jar files we can first unzip them, then use a tool called jad and run that on the class file.

Looking though the decompiled files I found the following in "BlockyCore"

```
public BlockyCore()
    {
        sqlHost = "localhost";
        sqlUser = "root";
        sqlPass = "8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22";
```


## Initial Compromise


So we now have a password and some potential usernames like "root", "admin" and "notch". So next I just tried these combinations against all the services (ftp, ssh, Wordpress, PhpMyadmin).

And I got a hit on both FTP and  SSH using the notch user and that password.

```

```

The ftp server gives us acces directly to the users home directory. So here we could just upload our public ssh key to be able to log in using SSH without any password.

But as we see below we could just simply login with the password we found as well.

## Pivilege Escalation

A typical Linux privilege escalation method is based on one of the following:

1. Exploiting services running as root
2. Exploiting SUID executables
3. Exploiting SUDO rights/user
4. Exploiting badly configured cron jobs
5. Exploiting users with "." in their path
6. Kernel Exploits

Kernel exploits are typically our last resort, as there is a risk that we crash the system in the process. 

There are several scripts that automates this process for us.

So I go to /dev/shm and upload a privsc script called LinEnum.

Going through all the output of that script we see the following interesting stuff:

```
[+] We're a member of the (lxd) group - could possibly misuse these rights!
uid=1000(notch) gid=1000(notch) groups=1000(notch),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare)       
```
Also I noticed that there was no sudo information from the scipt, lets run that manually.

We can list our sudo rights with sudo -l. We need to specify our password to list these, this is probably why the script failed to do so.

```
notch@Blocky:/dev/shm$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for notch: 
Matching Defaults entries for notch on Blocky:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User notch may run the following commands on Blocky:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

So we have SUDO rights to all the commands on the host. So we can simply just sudo to the root user.

```
notch@Blocky:/dev/shm$ sudo su
root@Blocky:/dev/shm# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@Blocky:/dev/shm# 
```
