# Hackthebox-writeups

This series of write-up's are aimed to show my methodology and steps I use when on a penetration test. I will try to find multiple ways to achieve every goal and I will also take steps to evade potential detection mechanisms.

There are a ton of write-up's out there already, but documenting these is a crucial step in my learning process as it forces me to iterate through it all one more time. 

"Repetitio est mater studiorum" - Repetition is the mother of all learning.
