# CTF-writeups

This series of write-up's are mainly aimed on boot2root boxes on Hackthebox and Vulnhub. I will also add Binary exploitation and Reversing as I explore these avenues deeper.

There are a ton of write-up's out there already, but documenting these is a crucial step in my learning process as it forces me to iterate through it all one more time. 

"Repetitio est mater studiorum" - Repetition is the mother of all learning.

## Binary Exploitation & Reversing

+ [Reversing and Exploiting Protostar Stack challenges](https://github.com/Bengman/CTF-writeups/blob/master/Binary_exploits/Protostar/Protostar_stack.md)
+ [Vulnserver "TRUN" command Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/Bengman/CTF-writeups/blob/master/Binary_exploits/vulnserver/vulnserver_trun_bof.py)
+ [Vulnserver "KSTET" command SEH egghunter](https://github.com/Bengman/CTF-writeups/blob/master/Binary_exploits/vulnserver/vulnserver_egghunter.py)
+ [Vulnserver "GMON" commnd SEH overflow](https://github.com/Bengman/CTF-writeups/blob/master/Binary_exploits/vulnserver/vulnserver_seh_overwrite.py)
